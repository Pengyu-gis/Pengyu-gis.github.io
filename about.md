## Internship & Research Experiences

- **Visiting Student & Research Assistant, Wuhan University**
  - *July 2023 -*
    - Trained the YOLO-based object detection algorithm and deployed the model compression to the K210 microcontroller.
    - Landed application: the model detects Tibetan brown bears, the K210 drives the water pump, and the bear spray is used to drive away the Tibetan brown bears.
    - Currently have a Chinese core journal in submission.
